    A grassroots group at the Univeristy of York that push the university to
    take real, urgent and effect action to tackle the climte and ecological
    emergency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Like everyone, we have had to adapt significantly to ensure that our work
    is safe during the COVID-19 pandemic. Nevertheless, climate justice activism
    remains essential in the current political climate. As such, we will be
    hosting further events in COVID safe ways.
  </p>
    <p>
      We will continue to host climate strikes, but they will look quite different to before! Watch this space for more info soon...
    </p><p>
  We will also be hosting informative and entertaining events. To enable as many people as possible to attend these, they will largely be taking place online. Again, we'll be sharing some exciting news in the near future, so keep an eye out!
  </p>
  <p>And we will be continuing to engage with the University's leadership, both with conversation and campaigning, in order to ensure that the University of York meets environmental standards befitting a large and prestigious institution.

    <h2>what is the point</h2>
    <p>
      The living planet is almost totally fucked. We are in the sixth mass
      extinction event and little is being done in proportion to the crisis we
      are (currently) living through. University of York's response? Cost
      benifit analysis that priorise the profit making of the univerity over
      people and planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time to stand up, speak out and take action to make change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Join us. The world ain't gonna change itself, but with you it just
      might

    <h2>What have we asked for?</h2>
    <div class="demands">

    <p>A concrete target of carbon neutrality by 2030, in line with York City Council, and YUSUâ€™s declaration of a climate emergency;
</p>
    <p>Introducing a carbon budget for university paid for travel</p>
    <p>Creating a minimum-waste campus;</p>
    <p>Using its influence to put pressure on York City Council to improve the environmental impact of all of its policies, especially those that particularly affect students</p>
    <p>Greening the curriculum - as part of diversifying and decolonising the curriculum</p>

      we sent to the Vice Chancellor last acedemic year. We're rightly
      pissed off and don't have the power to make the changes ourself
