    A grassroots group at the Univeristy of York that push the university to
    take real, urgent and effect action to tackle the climte and ecological
    emergency.
  </p>
  <div class="">
    <h2>Our demands</h2>
    <p>ONE: The university must declare a climate and ecological emergency</p>
    <p>TWO: A cheeky revolution</p>
    <p>THREE: etc</p>
    <p>

      we sent to the Vice Chancellor last acedemic year. We're rightly
      pissed off and don't have the power to make the changes ourself

  <div class="">
    <h2>what is the point</h2>
    <p>
      The living planet is almost totally fucked. We are in the sixth mass
      extinction event and little is being done in proportion to the crisis we
      are (currently) living through. University of York's response? Cost
      benifit analysis that priorise the profit making of the univerity over
      people and planet.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is time to stand up, speak out and take action to make change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Join us, pls. The world ain't gonna change itself, but with you it just
      might
